# Full-Stack Take-Home Challenge: League of Legends Match Stats Dashboard


## Overview:

Design and build a dynamic, visually appealing web application that provides a comprehensive overview of a League of Legends summoner's stats using the Riot Games API ([https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal)).

To provide some visual inspiration for the dashboard layout and components, youâ€™ll find attached a screenshot of our application for the LoL player profile. Please note that this is just a suggestion, and feel free to be creative and come up with your own unique design.

Given a summoner name (you can find summoner names on [https://mobalytics.gg/lol/search/live-games/](https://mobalytics.gg/lol/search/live-games/) or any other tracker), the application should display:
